This task is not completed

add & delete are implemented, but search needs some time to be done

User interface is under construction, an interactive interface to choose action and parameters would be ideal

First Name is taken as the primary referece (key) for the address book

Email and Phone number should also be taken as available keys, which could be taken to use with First name, but the implementation will take time

So they remained not implemented

Unfinished Tasks:

1. Phone number and Email implementation

2. Search function

3. User interactive interface


To finish this program, it will take 2-3 more days 
(this is a conservative estimation, if no serious bug or issue is found, 1-1.5 days would be more reasonable)
